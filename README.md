# Sana Benefits Air Quality 

## Prompt:
- Use the air quality API to build an asthma warning tool.
- API info is available here: https://aqicn.org/api/ - you'll need to get an API token to use it.
- The interface should support multiple users
- Each user should be able to set up their location and warning threshold
- Once a user with their info set up logs in we need to tell them if the air quality at their location is above or under the threshold they specified earlier

- You may use any framework / libraries that you would like, or none at all.
- Once complete, zip up your source code and send it over for review.

We're looking for a few things here:
- Overall execution
- Code readability
- A clean front-end (we don't expect you to be a designer, but the UI should be easy to understand how to use)
